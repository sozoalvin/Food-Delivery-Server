<h2>Tech Stacks Employed</h2>

<p>Amazon Web Services RD2 - mySQL</p>
<p>Amazon Web Servies Https LB - load balanced</p>

<h2>Development Envirnonment</h2> 
<p>For development purposes in your own environment, use the following command once you've in the working directory</p>

```go run .```

<p>You can access the server on <i>localhost</i> or <i>localhost:80</i> if the former doesn't work</p>

<h2>Testing for Production</h2>
<p>To check if your program is ready for production, use the following command.</p>

```go run . -productionFlg```

<p>You can access the server on <i>localhost</i> if the former doesn't work</p>
<p>When production flag is activated, requests routed on port:80 will be automatically routed to port:443</p>
<p>If you open up chrome's dev tools, you'll see HTTP/1.1 and then see a HTTP/2 almost immedidately</p>

<h2>Launching on an Actual Web Server</h2>

```go run . -productionFlg -domain www.yourdomainname.com```
